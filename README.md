This is a registration form component page that is reuseable and highly redesignable for clients just add your code for the navigation bar, footer, and whatever components you have and enjoy a registration form.

*Note that you will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.*


## Get started

Install the dependencies...


'''
cd auth form
npm install
```



'''
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

You now can view the app on your local host computer port.
